This is a project to showcase my SQL/Excel/Tableau skills using Olympic Historical Dataset. 

I would like to look at countries' olympic successes from GDP perspective and to have a closer look at USA Female Gymnastics Olympic Team members if there is a significant change over time in terms of their biometric measurements.
.

## Olympic Data: [Data Files](https://github.com/culhaci/Project/tree/master/Data_Files) 
These files are historical Olympic Data (1896-2016). xxxxxxxx beginning by using SQL to extract data, excel to clean data, and analyizing data in Tableau. Finally, ........... using visualizations all in Tableau.

This dataset is publicly available at [www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).

The data contains 120 years of Olympic history: athletes,results and basic bio data (age, height and weight) on athletes and medal results from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. This "Olympic" data consists of 2 parts: Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics.

## Historical GDP Data: 
GDP per capita is a measure of a country's economic output that accounts for its number of people. It divides the country's gross domestic product by its total population. That makes it the best measurement of a country's standard of living. GDP Per Capita is measured in US Dollars and the higher is dollar amount, shows a higher quality of life.For more information, [link](https://www.google.com/search?ei=sU88XMuTOtrC0PEP__WG0AU&q=gdp+per+capita+definition&oq=gdp+per+capita+&gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.0i67l7j0j0i67l2.13402.13402..15110...0.0..0.82.82.1......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71.NSd4EQsxHEg).

For GDP_Per_Capita, I used the United Nations publicly available data sets ([link](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/database/index.shtml)).

# Calculations using Excel:
# Olympic Data: 
In order to calculate the Sum of Medal Counts, I created a "Dummy Variable", named as "Medal" in Excel using "IF/Condition"function.
# GDP Data:
I would like to use GDP Per Capita amounts together with its ranking amoung other countries. There fore, I used the "Rank" function in Excel to calculate the Rankings.
