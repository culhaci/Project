This is a project to showcase my SQL skills using Olympic Historical Dataset. I would like to look at countries' olympic success from GDP perspective and to have a closer look at to USA Female Gymnastics Olympic Team members if there is a significant change over time in terms of their biometric measurements.
.

## Olympic Data: [Data Files](https://github.com/culhaci/Project/tree/master/Data_Files) 
These files are historical Olympic Data (1896-2016). xxxxxxxx beginning by using SQL to extract data, excel to clean data, and analyizing data in Tableau. Finally, ........... using visualizations all in Tableau.

This dataset is publicly available at (https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).

The data contains 120 years of Olympic history: athletes,results and basic bio data (age, height and weight) on athletes and medal results from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. This "Olympic" data consists of 2 parts: Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics.

## Historical GDP Data: 
GDP per capita is a measure of a country's economic output that accounts for its number of people. It divides the country's gross domestic product by its total population. That makes it the best measurement of a country's standard of living.

#### #Calculations:
In order to calculate the Sum of Medal Counts, I created a "Dummy Variable", named as "Medal" in Excel using "IF/Condition" structures.
